# Data

The files in this directory give the Latitude and Longitude for each postcode. They were created by using the `lat` and `long` columns in the [ONS postcode lookup](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/items/national-statistics-postcode-lookup-august-2018). The postcode data from ONS (derived from Code-PointÂ® Open) are [released under the Open Government Licence](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences).
