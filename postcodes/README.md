# Data

The files in this directory give the Latitude and Longitude for each postcode. They were created by using the `lat` and `long` columns in the [National Statistics Postcode Lookup - 2021 Census (May 2025) for the UK](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/077631e063eb4e1ab43575d01381ec33/about). The postcode data from ONS (derived from Code-PointÂ® Open) are [released under the Open Government Licence](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences).
